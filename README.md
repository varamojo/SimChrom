This repository provides scripts for simulating chromatin 3D structures and calculating the Euclidean distances between intrachromosomal loci, visualised as violin plots. These scripts can be used for structural analysis of chromatin, identifying spatial relationships within genomic data, and generating visualizations of chromatin interactions.
